        The <span> HyperText Markup Language </span> or <span>HTML</span> is the

          >web browser</a

        and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
        storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
        the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        the appearance of the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">HTML elements</a> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With
        HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
        embedded into the rendered page. <a href="#">HTML provides</a> a means to
        create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such
        as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
        <a href="#">HTML elements</a> are delineated by tags, written using
        <a href="#">angle brackets</a>. Tags such as and directly introduce
        content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information
        about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers
        do not display the <a href="#">HTML tags</a> but use them to interpret the
        content of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML can embed <a href="#">programs</a> written in a scripting language
        such as <a href="#">JavaScript</a>, which affects the behavior and content
        of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and
        current<a href="#"> maintainer</a> of the <a href="#">CSS standards</a>,
        has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since
        1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as<a href="#"> HTML5</a>, is used to
        display video and audio, primarily using the element, in collaboration
        with javascript.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at<a href="#"> CERN</a>,
        proposed and prototyped <a href="#">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for CERN
        researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
        proposing an <a href="#">Internet-based</a> hypertext system.[3]
        Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in
        late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer
        <a href="#">Robert Cailliau</a> collaborated on a joint request for
        funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal
        notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext
        is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first publicly available <a href="#">description</a> of HTML was a
        document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim
        Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the
        initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the
        <a href="#">hyperlink tag</a>, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid,
        an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based
        documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML
        4.[8]
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is a <a href="#">markup language</a> that web browsers use to
        interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or
        audible <a href="#">web pages</a>. Default characteristics for every item
        of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can
        be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS.
        Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR
        9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early
        text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command
        developed in the early 1960s for the <a href="#">CTSS</a> (Compatible
        Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were
        derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format
        documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on
        elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes)
        <a href="#">rather</a> than merely print effects, with also the separation
        of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this
        direction with CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">Berners-Lee</a> considered HTML to be an application of SGML.
        It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force
        (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML
        specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by
        Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type
        definition to define the grammar.[9][10] The draft expired after six
        months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic
        browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's
        philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave
        Raggett's competing <a href="#">Internet-Draft</a>, "HTML+ (Hypertext
        Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing
        already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]
      </p>
      <p>
        After the <a href="#">HTML</a> and <a href="#">HTML+</a> drafts expired in
        early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995
        completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated
        as a standard against which future implementations should be based.[12]
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">Further</a> development under the auspices of the IETF was
        stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have
        been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World
        Wide <a href="#">Web Consortium</a> (W3C).[13] However, in 2000, HTML also
        became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was
        published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In
        2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application
        Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with
        the <a href="#">W3C</a> in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28
        October 2014.[14]
